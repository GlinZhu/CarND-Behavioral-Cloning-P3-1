# **Behavioral Cloning Project** 

## Writeup Report

## Overview
The entire goal of this project is to train the Convoluntional Neural Network(CNN) to predict the steering angle based on the given training data. The car in the simulator was equipped with three cameras which are able to provide left, center and right images of road conditions. By giving the training data, the CNN model was trained and able to generate the steering commands from the video images of three cameras. This problem turns out to be a regression task which is different from traditional classification task.
